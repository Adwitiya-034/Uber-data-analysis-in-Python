# Uber-data-analysis-in-Python
Analyzed Uber ride data to uncover trends, peak usage times and geographic distribution of rides.
Preprocessed and cleaned raw Uber ride data (100,000+ records) using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to handle missing and inconsistent entries.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize patterns in ride frequency and trip distance.
Utilized Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and reporting.
Conducted geospatial analysis to map ride hotspots using Folium.
Uncovered key insights: highest demand during evenings and weekends, strong correlation between days and hour and location of maximum rides in Newyork.
